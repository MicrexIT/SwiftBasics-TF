Currently, Swift is being tested as a viable language for data science and especially deep learning. A few years ago, Google announced to be working on a swift implementation for tensorflow. [Swift for TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift) (S4TF) aims to solve some of the drawbacks of its Python counterpart. Whether it suceeds or not, there's everything to gain and nothing to lose by getting a basic understanding of the techonolgy.\n",
